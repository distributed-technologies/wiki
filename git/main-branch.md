# Main branch requirement for Yggdrasil
This is the documentation for our main branch requirements for Yggdrasil. The main branch of Yggdrasil should always be kept in a state where it only contains the base services of the platform and any applications, workflows or dashboards etc. are not part of it. This main branch will only contain code that is already acceptance and integration tested, so that any code that is on the main branch is verified to work on the platform, as well as code reviewed. When Yggdrasil is deployed onto a cluster, all of the external references in Yggdrasil should be made to a main branch in an umbrella chart. If the main branch requirements for umbrella charts that are written below is then fulfilled, we are sure that everything running on Yggdrasil is both tested as well as reviewed. 

# Main branch requirement for umbrella charts
This is the documentation for our main branch requirements for our umbrella charts. All of our umbrella charts should always use the main branch as the one that should be referenced from Yggdrasil. This helps us make sure that any code that is pushed to the main repository has been through a code review, as well as make sure that it is the latest stable and tested version of the umbrella chart that runs on the cluster.
