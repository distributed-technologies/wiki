# Git structure

All our git repositories will always contain two files:

- README.md
- LICENSE

### README.md

will contain the general description of the repository, 
links to the further documentation and how to build, 
install and use the repo.

### LICENCE

Most often we will go with the Apache 2.0 licence.
